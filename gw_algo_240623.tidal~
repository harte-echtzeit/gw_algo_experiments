-- some playing with GW and simple algorithms

-- grab some interesting integer sequences here e.g. OEIS
let list_oeis = [1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 6, 4, 6, 4, 10, 4, 12, 6, 8, 8, 16, 6, 18, 8, 12, 10, 22, 8, 20, 12, 18, 12, 28, 8, 30, 16]

-- defs of some very simple list manipulation
reOrgList n x = drop n x ++ take n x
maskPat l x = take l x
maskPat' o l x = take l (drop o x)


-- short
let a = reOrgList 8 list_oeis
    pat = listToPat (maskPat 8 a)

d2 $ n pat # s "cpu2" # gain 0.5
